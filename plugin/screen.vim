" Description: {{{
"   Note: gvim is not supported. You must be running vim in a console.
"
"   Currently tested on Linux and cygwin, but should work on any unix based
"   platform where screen is supported (OSX, BSD, Solaris, etc.).  Note that
"   in my testing of cygwin, invocations of screen were significantly slower
"   and less fluid than on Linux.
"
"   This plugin aims to simulate an embedded shell in vim by allowing you to
"   easily convert your current vim session into one running in gnu screen
"   with a split gnu screen window containing a shell, and to quickly send
"   statements/code to whatever program is running in that shell (bash,
"   python, irb, etc.).
"
"   Commands:
"     :ScreenShell [cmd] - Opens the split shell by doing the following:
"       1. save a session file from your currently running vim instance
"          (current tab only)
"       2. start gnu screen with vim running in it
"       3. load your saved session file
"       4. create a lower gnu screen split window and start a shell
"       5. if a command was supplied to :ScreenShell, run it
"          Ex. :ScreenShell ipython
"
"       Note: If you are already in a gnu screen session, then only steps
"             4 and 5 above will be run.
"
"     :ScreenSend - Send the visual selection or the entire buffer contents to
"                   the running gnu screen shell window.
"
"     :ScreenQuit - Save all currently modified vim buffers and quit gnu
"                   screen, returning you to your previous vim instance
"                   running outside of gnu screen
"       Note: :ScreenQuit is not available if you where already in a gnu
"             screen session when you ran :ScreenShell.
"       Note: By default, if the gnu screen session was started by
"             :ScreenShell, then exiting vim will quit the gnu screen session
"             as well (configurable via g:ScreenShellQuitOnVimExit).
"
"   An example workflow may be:
"     Open a python file to work on:
"       $ vim something.py
"
"     Decide you want to run all or pieces of the code in an interactive
"     python shell:
"       :ScreenShell python
"
"     Send code from a vim buffer to the shell:
"       :ScreenSend
"
"     Quit the screen session and return to your original vim session:
"       :ScreenQuit
"         or
"       :qa
"
"   Gotchas:
"     - While running vim in gnu screen, if you detach the session instead of
"       quitting, then when returning to the non-screen vim, vim will complain
"       about swap files already existing.  So try to avoid detaching.
"     - Not all vim plugins support saving state to or loading from vim
"       session files, so when running :ScreenShell some buffers may not load
"       correctly if they are backed by such a plugin.
