" Description: {{{
"   This plugin aims to simulate an embedded shell in vim by allowing you to
"   easily convert your current vim session into one running in gnu screen
"   with a split gnu screen window containing a shell, and to quickly send
"   statements/code to whatever program is running in that shell (bash,
"   python, irb, etc.).  Spawning the shell in your favorite terminal emulator
"   is also supported for gvim users or anyone else that just prefers an
"   external shell.
"
"   Currently tested on Linux and Windows (win32 [g]vim and cygwin vim), but
"   should also work on any unix based platform where screen is supported
"   (OSX, BSD, Solaris, etc.).  Note that in my testing of cygwin, invocations
"   of screen were significantly slower and less fluid than on Linux.  The
"   Windows experience is better when using gvim to spawn a cygwin shell
"   running screen.
"
"   Windows Users: Whether you are using gvim or not, you will need cygwin
"   installed with cygwin's bin directory in your windows PATH.
"
"   Commands:
"     :ScreenShell [cmd] - Starts a screen hosted shell performing the
"       following steps depending on your environment.
"
"       When running a console vim on a unix based OS (Linux, BSD, OSX):
"         1. save a session file from your currently running vim instance
"            (current tab only)
"         2. start gnu screen with vim running in it
"         3. load your saved session file
"         4. create a lower gnu screen split window and start a shell, or if
"            g:ScreenShellExternal is set, start an external terminal with
"            screen running.
"         5. if a command was supplied to :ScreenShell, run it in the new
"            shell.
"            Ex. :ScreenShell ipython
"
"         Note: If you are already in a gnu screen session, then only steps
"               4 and 5 above will be run.
"
"       When running gvim:
"         1. start an external terminal with screen running.
"         2. if a command was supplied to :ScreenShell, run it in the new
"            shell.
"            Ex. :ScreenShell ipython
"
"     :ScreenSend - Send the visual selection or the entire buffer contents to
"       the running gnu screen shell window.
"
"     :ScreenQuit - Save all currently modified vim buffers and quit gnu
"       screen, returning you to your previous vim instance running outside of
"       gnu screen
"       Note: :ScreenQuit is not available if you where already in a gnu
"         screen session when you ran :ScreenShell.
"       Note: By default, if the gnu screen session was started by
"         :ScreenShell, then exiting vim will quit the gnu screen session as
"         well (configurable via g:ScreenShellQuitOnVimExit).
"
"     :ScreenShellAttach [session] - Sets the necessary internal variables to allow
"       :ScreenSend invocations to send to the specified screen session.  If
"       no session is provided, then the first session found is used.  If the
"       session is in the "Detached" state, then a new terminal is opened with
"       a new screen instance attached to the session. Attaching to a detached
"       session is not currently supported on windows due to deficiencies in
"       the cygwin version of gnu screen.  Also note, that for screen sessions
"       attached to via this mechanism, :ScreenSend invocations will send the
"       text to the active screen window instead of targeting the 'shell'
"       window when used from :ScreenShell.
"
"   An example workflow may be:
"     Open a python file to work on:
"       $ vim something.py
"
"     Decide you want to run all or pieces of the code in an interactive
"     python shell:
"       :ScreenShell python
"
"     Send code from a vim buffer to the shell:
"       :ScreenSend
"
"     Quit the screen session and return to your original vim session:
"       :ScreenQuit
"         or
"       :qa
"
"   Configuration:
"     - g:ScreenShellHeight (Default: 15): Sets the height of gnu screen
"       region used for the shell.
"     - g:ScreenShellQuitOnVimExit (Default: 1): When non-zero and the gnu
"       screen session was started by this script, the screen session will be
"       closed when vim exits.
"     - g:ScreenShellExternal (Default: 0): When non-zero and not already in a
"       screen session, an external shell will be spawned instead of using a
"       split region for the shell.  Note: when using gvim, an external shell
"       is always used.
"     - g:ScreenShellServerName: If the gnu screen session is started by this
"       plugin, then the value of this setting will be used for the servername
"       arg of the vim instance started in the new gnu screen session (not
"       applicable for gvim users).  The default is 'vim' unless you have
"       g:ScreenShellExternal enabled, in which case, if you still want to
"       restart vim in a screen session with a servername, then simply set
"       this variable in your vimrc.
"     - g:ScreenShellTerminal (Default: ''): When g:ScreenShellExternal is
"       enabled or you are running gvim, this value will be used as the name
"       of the terminal executable to be used.  If this value is empty, a list
"       of common terminals will be tried until one is found.
"
"   Gotchas:
"     - While running vim in gnu screen, if you detach the session instead of
"       quitting, then when returning to the non-screen vim, vim will complain
"       about swap files already existing.  So try to avoid detaching.
"     - Not all vim plugins support saving state to or loading from vim
"       session files, so when running :ScreenShell some buffers may not load
"       correctly if they are backed by such a plugin.
